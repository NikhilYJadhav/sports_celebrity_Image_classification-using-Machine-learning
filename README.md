# sports_celebrity_Image_classification-using-Machine-learning

In this data science and machine learning project, we classify sports personalities. We restrict classification to only 5 people,

Maria Sharapova
Serena Williams
Virat Kohli
Roger Federer
Lionel Messi
Here is the folder structure,

UI : This contains ui website code
server: Python flask server
model: Contains python notebook for model building
google_image_scrapping: code to scrap google for images
images_dataset: Dataset used for our model training
Technologies used in this project,

Python
Numpy and OpenCV for data cleaning
Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
Sklearn for model building
Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
Python flask for http server
HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI


I am currently working on this project and have completed data cleaning process with different machine learning algorithms applied on it such svm,  logistic regression, random forest, and to come up with best model and accuracy.
I have already came up with SVM and logistic best model building in my algorithm you can check in .py file of folder, and will be continuing with flask and html to complete and put on website.
